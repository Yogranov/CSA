This is a little CTF Ive built last year with BIG inspire from Checkpoint csa.
The site is not online in this days, so if you want to try the CTF by yourself follow those instructions:

1. Read the letter down below.
2. The image 'what.png' was attach to the email, use it.
3. When you get the URL, please open 'j59xr6eup9xa8bjssssoij80goh4ufghuapzvi8n.php' file, not a second before.
4. The flag format is CSA{...}.

Note:
Yes... You can find the flag inside 'checkFlag.php', <br>
obviously it should be server side, but you are in github and see the whole code :)


---------- Your adventure starts here ----------

Hey CSA staff!

I just got this message and I don't know how to open it :(
That message came with a note that says:

"
I am a top secret message for CSA.
You will able to read me right here:
https://csa.845.co.il/

you just need to find the secret flag first :)

Good luck,
Agent Y
